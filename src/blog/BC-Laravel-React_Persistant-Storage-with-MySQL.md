title: Bigcommerce App using Laravel and React - Pesistant Storage with MySQL
description: Setting up a sample application with Laravel and React to interface with BigCOmmerce

This tutorial will walk you though the steps to get our Laravel React application up and running with persistant storage using MySQL.
It's purpose is to fast-track your apps ability to persist authentication across session, while given you an introduction to Laravel's migration service and ORM.

At the end, your application will be able to persist authentication across sessions, and persist data. You can run it locally, or install on your BigCommerce store.

## Prerequisites
Before jumping in, youâ€™ll want to make sure you are up to speed with our previous tutorial in this series. ([Link to Guide](https://))
Furthermore, you should have installed MySQL or similar on your local machine - maybe you already have a server running you can use.
We won't provide the steps here on how to install, but we have some links to some great resources:

- MacOS ([Installation Guide](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-on-macos-using-homebrew/))
- Windows ([Installation Guide](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-msi-packages-on-windows/))

## Setting up a new Database and User

Our journey starts in the terminal by connecting to our mySQL server

```bash
mysql
```

Your prompt should look something like this:

![MySQL Welcome Screen](/assets/images/MySQL-welcome.png)

Let's create a new database for our app:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE laravel_react_sample_app;
```

Next we will create a dedicated user to use with our newly created database. In this example laravel is the username and password is the password.
Change to something appropriately.

```sql
CREATE USER 'laravel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
```

Next up we will grant user permissons. Do note that you might not want to grant all privileges in production. Please consult with the MySQL documentation
([Available MySQL Priviledges](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#privileges-provided-summary))

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON laravel_react_sample_app.* TO 'laravel'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Let's flush the privileges to make sure they are taking into effect

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Lastly, we can verify the users permissions
```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'laravel'@'localhost';
```

It should look something like this in your terminal

```sql
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for laravel@localhost                                                                                                                                                                       |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, REFERENCES, ALTER ON *.* TO `laravel`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*74EA68F9C1CEABA1DA3671D46ADC6535EACD8163' WITH GRANT OPTION |
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `laravel_react_sample_app`.* TO `laravel`@`localhost` WITH GRANT OPTION                                                                                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Exit the MySQL server by executing 
```sql
quit;
```

## Setting up MySQL in Laravel

Setting up the connection between your Laravel project and the MySQL database only require us to add our connection information to the projects `.env` file found in the projects root folder

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel_react_sample_app
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

Let's test it out to make sure we are connected to our database. By inserting the following snippet temporarily into `./resources/views/app.blade.php` we will be able to connect to our MySQL database and output the database name, if everything went ok.
Insert the snippet between the `<body>...</body>` tags:
```php
    <strong>Check DB Connection: </strong>
    <?php
        try {
            \DB::connection()->getPDO();
            echo \DB::connection()->getDatabaseName();
            } catch (\Exception $e) {
            dd($e);
        }
    ?>      
```

If something has gone, you should see an error message similar to these, that can help you pin point what the issue might be:

```
#message: "SQLSTATE[HY000] [1045] Access denied for user 'wrong_username'@'localhost' (using password: YES)"
---
#message: "SQLSTATE[HY000] [1049] Unknown database 'I_DONT_EXIST_DB'"
```

Remember to remove the snippet when you are done verifying the connection is established.

## Migrations

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing us to define and share the application's database schema definition. 
Laravel provides built-in tools for creating and modifying database tables and columns.

Before we start creating our migrations, let's revisit `./app/Http/Controllers/MainController.php` to summarize the steps we are currently taking to authorize our app.

In our `install` function, if the `$statusCode` returns `200` we store `store_hash`,`access_token`, `user_id`, and `user_email` in our session for later retrieval.

In `load` function, if our request is verified we store `user_id`, `user_email`, `owner_id`, `owner_email`, and `store_hash` in our session for later retrieval.

In `getAccessToken` and `getStoreHash` we can see that in both cases requests are being made to the session so this will be the minimal viable values that we want to store in our database.
However, for convenience sake, let's expand our table with all the values mentioned above, and a few more that can be used for supporting multi-user apps later on.
Our final table will looks like this:

| user_id | user_email | locale | store_hash | account_uuid | access_token | timestamp | date_created |
|---------|------------|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|-----------| -------------|

### Creating our first migration

To create a new migration, first navigate to the projects root folder and execute the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_bc_auth_table
```

This command will generate a new migrations file in `./database/migrations`.
Laravel will use the name of the migration command to attempt to guess the name of the table and whether or not the migration will be creating a new table. 
If Laravel is able to determine the table name from the migration name, Laravel will pre-fill the generated migration file with the specified table. 
It should be named something like this `2023_05_02_create_bc_auth_table.php`, open the file and let's add our columns.

Replace the `up()` function with the follwing:

```php
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('bc_auth', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->unsignedBigInteger('user_id');
            $table->string('user_email', 255);
            $table->string('locale', 255);
            $table->string('store_hash', 255);
            $table->string('account_uuid', 255);
            $table->string('access_token', 255);
            $table->integer('timestamp');
            $table->date('created_at');
        });
    }
```

You can find additional column types here ([Available Column Types](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/migrations#creating-columns))


We can then attempt to create the database table:
```bash
php artisan migrate --path=/database/migrations/2023_05_08_101405_create_bc_auth_table.php
```

If we log back into our MySQL server, we should now be able to see the table and columns created by the migration:

```sql
USE laravel_react_sample_app; SHOW COLUMNS FROM bc_auth;

+--------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field        | Type                | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+--------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| user_id      | bigint(20) unsigned | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| user_email   | varchar(255)        | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| locale       | varchar(255)        | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| store_hash   | varchar(255)        | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| account_uuid | varchar(255)        | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| access_token | varchar(255)        | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| timestamp    | int(11)             | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| created_at   | date                | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+--------------+---------------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```
